- Gossip protocol for discovering TCP endpoints.
- Distributed Actors (Erlang-style processes) with mailboxes, selective receive, group registration and monitoring.
- Simple backpressure between actors.
- Basic Paxos using actors.
- Leader election using Basic Paxos.
- Simple persistent transactional key-value storage.
- Stream replication for the key-value storage.
- Fencing token for configuring replication between leaders and followers.
